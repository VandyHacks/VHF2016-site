        Jeff Rothschild joined Facebook in 2005 as one of the earliest and most experienced
        executives. He helped the social networking site scale as its vice president of

        2010. He left Facebook in June 2015. Before Facebook, Rothschild, a Vanderbilt University
        School of Engineering alumnus, started out developing network storage technologies at
        Honeywell and Intel. He also cofounded several of his own Silicon Valley firms, the largest
        of which, Veritas Software, was sold to Symantec for $13.5 billion in stock in 2004.
        Rothschild is now focused on technology investing and serves on the boards of startups
        Primary Data, Interana and Lytmus. A trustee of Vanderbilt University, he became vice
