	      <p>
          Founded in the spring of 2015, VandyHacks was the first collegiate
          hackathon to call the rockin' city of Nashville, Tennessee home.  Now, we're
          proud to bring you VandyHacks II- and it's gonna be even bigger and better. From
          October 2-4, 250+ students from universities all over the nation will meet at
          Vanderbilt University for a weekend of collaboration, innovation, and great food
          (#southernhospitality).
          We hope to see y'all there!
